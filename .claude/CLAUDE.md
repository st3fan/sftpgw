# Bash: commands
- `go build` to build the project
- `go test` to test the project
- `go vet` to lint the project

# Go
- Do not use deprecated functions
- Prefer the identifier name `con` instead of `conn`

# Workflow
- Be sure to lint when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
